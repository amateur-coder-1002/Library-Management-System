# Library-Management-System

A library management system that allows members to reserve, borrow and return books.
Everytime a user reserves a book, the request is sent to the admins who issues the book to the member. When a book is reserved, issued and returned, the date is recorded.
A user is allowed to borrow a maximum of 5 books only at a time.

Admins are allowed to make changes to the details of the books and look at status of all the books.

For the UI I have used JavaFX and My-SQL for the back-end.
