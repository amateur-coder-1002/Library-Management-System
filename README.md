# Library-Management-System

A library management system that allows members to search, reserve, borrow and return books. For the UI I have used JavaFX and My-SQL for the back-end.


Everytime a user reserves a book, the request is sent to the admins who issues the book to the member. When a book is reserved, issued and returned, the date is recorded.
A user is allowed to borrow a maximum of 5 books only at a time.


Admins are allowed to add new books, make changes to the details of the books and look at the status of all the books.

Further features to be implemented:
- Creating a new member account
- Printing the records of books and ones been borrowed
- A way to make changes to the settings(like the number of max books to be borrowed) without direcetly accessing the database.
